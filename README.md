## Purpose

I am currently enrolled in the iOS Foundations course on [CodeWithChris](https://codewithchris.com/) and just finished learning about JSON Parsing, Navigation Views, Scroll Views, and the MVVM (Models, Views, ViewModels) organizational structure. To practice these new skills, I created this app. Scroll Views are used on all pages to allow overflowing content to be scrolled, Navigation Views are used to link all the pages together, JSON is used to store all of the information about each language, and the entire project is structured with MVVM in mind. It is a simple project but has helped me solidify the new concepts I've learned.

## Prerequisites

To be able to open this project you must have a MacOS system with XCode installed.
